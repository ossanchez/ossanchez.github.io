title: First Week Feb 2020
---

The first week of February was very busy. I had a visit staying at my place and made some small trips around Amsterdam.


## 1. My friend Marco came for a visit

I've known Marco for many years. We met at church and later on we were flatmates at college. He contacted me in November telling me that he was applying to assist a conference in Amsterdam. He was not sure if he was going to be accepted or if he was coming for sure, but just wanted to know if I was available to let him stay at my flat during the conference.

Fast forward to last week when I received a voice message (he never texts only uses voice messages) from him letting me know he had the plane tickets and that he was arriving like in 2 days! Lucky for him I had nothing planned and was able to make time to host him.

It was nice having him around. It reminded me of the time we spent together in college. We have both changed, of course, but we still share that friendship. 


## 2. Visited Zaanse Schans

This is a place I take every person who visits me. Why? Well, even when it is an extremely touristy place it has a vibe of how small villages in the Netherlands looked many years ago. It has the cute green houses with their nice gardens, the small bridges in between the canals, the windmills and it even has a place where you can buy those wooden shoes (clogs). It is a perfect place for tourists.

Since we are still in February, the place was not so crowded. We got to walk along the windmills, take pictures in the bridges and with the wooden shoes, go inside the cheese shop and try different types of cheese (which is what I enjoy the most). We were also lucky enough to see a demonstration of how the clogs were made.

I might talk about Zaanse Schans, the things I like and don't like in a separate post. For now I'll keep this short.

## 3. Souvenir shopping

Before going home Marco had a huge list of souvenirs that he wanted to take back for his family, friends and co-workers. So I did what any expat enjoys the most, go to crowded touristy places and spend money on overpriced stuff...

In all honesty it went better than what I thought it would. We went to a cheese store, since Marco doesn't like cheese that much (come on! who doesn't like to taste free cheese samples), I got to taste many different types and decide which one was the best. Spend countless hours walking and going in to souvenir shops looking for the perfect magnet, walking through the Bloemenmarkt just looking at things and not buying anything, eating stroopwafles and looking for the perfect chocolate box.

At the end of the day he bought what he was looking for. He was quite happy to bring those things to the people that he cared about and that reminded me of my first time in Amsterdam and how I did the exact same thing.

## 4. Finished planning trip to Croatia

In March I'm planning to do a short trip to Croatia with two other friends. We bought the plane tickets a couple of weeks ago.

The original plan was to travel to Split, rent a car and travel to nearby places and then fly back from Split after a couple of days. Since we were not able to find a direct flight from Split to Amsterdam for the dates we wanted, we decided to change a bit. We are still flying to Split but we will be flying back from Zagreb.

I started looking at places worth visiting and decided to not over do it and take our time. So we will be starting at Split, then we will drive to Plitvice Lakes National Park, spend the day day here and then drive to Zadar. We will spend the night at Zadar and then we will head to Krka National Park, spend the day here and then drive to Zagreb as our final destination.

I know, I know... It is a very short visit, but Croatia seems like an extremely interesting country so it is probable I'll go back in the future for a longer trip and see what I won't be able to see in this short trip.

I will follow this in a future post to share my conclusions about the trip.

## 5. Marco went back home

After spending one week in Amsterdam, Marco had to go back home. His flight left very early in the morning so we had to wake up extremely early (4:45 am) so that he could take the first train to the airport. I went with him to the Train Station and said good by to him from there. 

It was nice seeing him and enjoying his company. I will definitely miss him, but I'm looking forward to meeting him again when I visit Costa Rica.
